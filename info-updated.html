            <h4>CryptoDust to Value</h4>
            <div class="box box_description">
                <p>
                    Everyone in the crypto world knows what "dust" is—small leftover tokens that accumulate in wallets
                    and usually just sit there, unused. We offer an innovative way to turn your dust into mining power.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Project Idea</h4>
            <div class="box box_description">
                <p>
                    Your meme tokens no longer have to take up space in your balance! We’ve created a platform where you
                    can exchange meme tokens for Hash Power to start mining our CDUST token. Instead of holding onto
                    useless leftovers, you’ll have the opportunity to earn through mining and become part of our
                    economy.

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <div class="box box_description">
                <p>
                    CDUST is an innovative Web3 mining game built on the Solana blockchain. It combines virtual
                    cryptocurrency mining with real-time, interactive gameplay. This document outlines the core
                    mechanics, tokenomics, and principles of the CDUST project to create a sustainable and rewarding
                    ecosystem.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <div class="box box_description">
                <p>
                    The expansion of blockchain and DeFi has opened the door to gamifying finance. CDUST builds on this
                    momentum with a new virtual mining experience on Solana, offering players the opportunity to mine
                    tokens using crypto dust instead of GPUs.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Mining Process</h4>
            <div class="box box_description">
                <p>
                    After connecting your wallet to the site, you immediately get access to mining. Rewards in CDUST
                    tokens are distributed daily, based on the amount of mining power (Crypto Dust) each user has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mining is divided into seasons. Each week, the amount of Crypto Dust distributed to all users is
                    recalculated. This dynamic distribution ensures a fair balance between newcomers and long-time
                    players.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Acquiring Crypto Dust</h4>
            <div class="box box_description">
                <p>
                    You can easily swap any of your tokens for Crypto Dust—the key mining resource—directly from your
                    wallet. Open the "Swap" tab and convert your unused crypto dust into Crypto Dust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crypto Dust is valid for 24 hours and then resets. You can purchase a new amount daily. This limited
                    lifespan ensures economic balance and prevents legacy users from permanently dominating mining
                    rewards.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Claiming Rewards</h4>
            <div class="box box_description">
                <p>
                    Your accumulated CDUST tokens can be claimed daily. Once claimed, tokens are automatically sent to
                    your withdrawal address.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Upgrade Strategy</h4>
            <div class="box box_description">
                <p>
                    To increase your share of mining rewards, you can swap larger amounts of tokens for Crypto Dust. Any
                    Solana-based token is supported, including SOL itself.
                </p>

                    CDUST offers a fresh take on virtual mining by using the Solana blockchain to create a fun,
                    engaging, and deflationary token ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By combining real blockchain utility with gamified mining mechanics, CDUST fosters an active
                    community and balanced token distribution. With transparent emissions, fair mining distribution, and
                    clear tokenomics, the project aims to build a sustainable long-term ecosystem.
