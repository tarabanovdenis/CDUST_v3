            <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
            <div class="box box_description box_outline">
                <p>
                    The rise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has opened new opportunities for gamification in the financial sector. CDUST leverages this potential by creating a virtual mining ecosystem on the Solana blockchain. Users can participate in cryptocurrency mining directly through a website, without the need for physical mining hardware.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Registration and Hash Power</h4>
            <div class="box box_description box_outline">
                <p>
                    Users join the CDUST ecosystem by registering through the official website. After registration, the system generates a unique mining wallet for each user. The core resource for mining is Hash Power, which is acquired by depositing SOL under the following terms:
                </p>
                <ul class="typo-text">
                    <li>0.1 SOL = 100 Hash Power</li>
                    <li>Minimum deposit: 0.105 SOL (including a 0.005 SOL transaction fee)</li>
                    <li>Hash Power is valid for 24 hours and must be renewed daily.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Block processing time is 1-2 minutes, ensuring a steady mining pace.</li>
                    <li>Each mined block distributes CDUST tokens to active miners proportionally to their Hash Power share in the network.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h4>Reward Distribution and Claiming</h4>
